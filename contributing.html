## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- iOS 17.0 SDK or later
- macOS 14.0 or later
- Swift 6.0 or later

### Getting Started
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aeropax-live.git

# Open in Xcode
cd aeropax-live
open AeroPax_Live.xcodeproj
```

### Project Structure
- `AeroPax_LiveApp.swift` - Main app entry point
- `ContentView.swift` - Main content view
- `FlightHistory.swift` - Flight record model
- `FlightHistoryView.swift` - Flight history interface
- `ArrivalAlertView.swift` - Arrival alert functionality

## Code Style Guidelines

### Swift Style
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Follow Apple's Swift naming conventions
- Use explicit `self` only when required
- Prefer `let` over `var` when possible
- Use trailing closures when appropriate

### SwiftUI Best Practices
- Break complex views into smaller, reusable components
- Use `@State` and `@Binding` appropriately
- Leverage SwiftData for persistence
- Use Swift Concurrency for async operations

### Example Code Style
```swift
import SwiftUI
import SwiftData

struct FlightDetailView: View {
    @State private var isLoading = false
    let flight: FlightRecord
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 16) {
            Text(flight.flightNumber)
                .font(.title)
            
            if isLoading {
                ProgressView()
            } else {
                flightDetails
            }
        }
        .padding()
    }
    
    private var flightDetails: some View {
        VStack {
            // Flight details implementation
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] App launches without crashes
- [ ] Location permissions work correctly
- [ ] Flight tracking records data accurately
- [ ] Flight history displays correctly
- [ ] Data persists after app restart
- [ ] UI looks good on different screen sizes
- [ ] Dark mode support works properly

### Automated Testing
If you're adding new features, consider adding tests using Swift Testing:
```swift
import Testing

@Test("Flight record saves correctly")
func testFlightRecordSaving() async throws {
    let record = FlightRecord(/* parameters */)
    // Test implementation
    #expect(record.isValid)
}
```

## Documentation

When adding new features:
- Update relevant `.md` files
- Add inline code comments for complex logic
- Update the README if necessary
- Document any new dependencies
